### Converting public transport data from GTFS format to GPS-like records

**gtfs2gps** is an R package that converts public transportation data in GTFS format to GPS-like records in a `data.frame`/`data.table`, which can then be used in various applications such as running transport simulations or scenario analyses. 

The core function of the package takes a `GTFS.zip` file and interpolates the space-time position of each vehicle in each trip considering the network distance and average speed between stops. The output is a `data.table` where each row represents the timestamp of each vehicle at a given spatial resolution. The package also has some functions to subset GTFS data in time and space and to convert both representations to [simple feature](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) format.

### Installation

Please install **gtfs2gps** package from CRAN to get the stable version.

``` r
install.packages("gtfs2gps")
library(gtfs2gps)
```
