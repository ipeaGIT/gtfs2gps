**gtfs2gps** is an R package that converts public transportation data in GTFS format to GPS-like records in a `data.frame`/`data.table`, which can then be used in various applications such as running transport simulations or scenario analyses. 

The core function of the package takes a `GTFS.zip` file and interpolates the space-time position of each vehicle in each trip considering the network distance and average speed between stops. The output is a `data.table` where each row represents the timestamp of each vehicle at a given spatial resolution. The package also has some functions to subset GTFS data in time and space and to convert both representations to [simple feature](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) format. More information about the methods used in the package can be found in this [preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qydr6/).
