abstract: Package `gtfs2gps` has a set of functions to convert public transport GTFS data to GPS-like format using `data.table`. It also has some functions to subset GTFS data in time and space and to convert both representations to simple feature format.

# Introduction 

Package `gtfs2gps` allows users to convert public transport GTFS data into a single `data.table` format with GPS-like records, which can then be used in various applications such as running transport simulations or scenario analyses. Before using the package, just install it from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ipeaGIT/gtfs2gps")
```

# Loading data

After loading the package, GTFS data can be read into R by using `read_gtfs()`.
This function gets a zipped GTFS file and returns a list of `data.table` objects. The returning list contains the data of each GTFS file indexed according to their file names without extension.

```{r}
library("gtfs2gps")
sao <- read_gtfs(system.file("extdata/saopaulo.zip", package="gtfs2gps"))
names(sao)
sao$trips
```

Note that not all GTFS files are loaded into R. This function only loads the necessary data to spatially and temporally handle trips and stops, which are:
- agency.txt
- calendar.txt
- routes.txt
- shapes.txt
- stop_times.txt
- stops.txt
- trips.txt
- frequencies.txt (this last one is optional).

If a given GTFS zipped file does not contain all of these required files then `read_gtfs()` will stop with an error.


# Subsetting GTFS Data

GTFS data sets can be fairly large for complex public transport networks and, in some cases, users might want to focus on specific transport services at week days/weekends, or on specific trips or routes. The package brings some functions to filter GTFS.zip and speed up the data processing.


\begin{description}
\item[filter\_by\_shape\_id():] Filter shapes using given shape ids.
\item[filter\_valid\_stop\_times():] Return only stop times that have geospatial locations.
\item[filter\_week\_days():] Remove weekend trips.
\item[filter\_single\_trip():] Return only one trip per shape\_id.
\end{description}

These functions subset all the relevant GTFS files in order to remove all the unnecessary rows, keeping the data consistent. The returning values of the four functions is a list of `data.table` objects, in the same way of the input data. For example, in the code below we filter only shape ids between 53000 and 53020.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
object.size(sao) %>% format(units = "Kb")
sao_small <- gtfs2gps::filter_by_shape_id(sao, c(51338, 51956, 51657))
object.size(sao_small) %>% format(units = "Kb")
```

We can then easily convert the data to simple feature format and plot them.

```{r}
sao_small_shapes_sf <- gtfs2gps::gtfs_shapes_as_sf(sao_small)
sao_small_stops_sf <- gtfs2gps::gtfs_stops_as_sf(sao_small)

plot(sf::st_geometry(sao_small_shapes_sf))
plot(sf::st_geometry(sao_small_stops_sf), pch = 20, col = "red", add = TRUE)
box()
```

After subsetting the data, it is also possible to save it as a new GTFS file using `write_gtfs()`, as shown below.

```{r}
write_gtfs(sao_small, "sao_small.zip")
```

# Converting to GPS-like format

To convert GTFS to GPS-like format, use `gtfs2gps()`. This is the core function of the package. It takes a GTFS zipped file as an input and returns a `data.table` where each row represents a 'GPS-like' data point for every trip in the GTFS file. In summary, this function interpolates the space-time position of each vehicle in each trip considering the network distance and average speed between stops. The function samples the timestamp of each vehicle every $15m$ by default, but the user can set a different value in the `spatial_resolution` argument. See the example below.

```{r}
  sao_gps <- gtfs2gps("sao_small.zip", progress = FALSE, cores = 1, spatial_resolution = 15)
  head(sao_gps)
```

 The following figure maps the first 100 data points of the sample data we processed.

```{r}
  shapes_sf <- gps_as_sf(sao_gps)
  sao_gps60 <- sao_gps[1:100, ]
  sao_gps60_sf <- gps_as_sf(sao_gps60)
  
  plot(sf::st_geometry(sao_gps60_sf), pch = 20)
  plot(sf::st_geometry(sao_small_shapes_sf), col = "blue", add = TRUE)
  box()

```



The function `gtfs2gps()` automatically recognises whether the GTFS data brings detailed `stop_times.txt` information or whether it is a `frequency.txt` GTFS file. A sample data of a GTFS with detailed  `stop_times.txt` cab be found below:

```{r}
poa <- system.file("extdata/poa.zip", package="gtfs2gps")
poa_gps <- gtfs2gps(poa, progress = FALSE)
poa_gps_sf <- gps_as_sf(poa_gps)
poa_sf <- read_gtfs(poa) %>% gtfs_shapes_as_sf()
plot(sf::st_geometry(poa_gps_sf[1:200,]))
plot(sf::st_geometry(poa_sf), col = "blue", add = TRUE)
box()
```


# Methodological note

For a given trip, the function `gtfs2gps` calculates the average speed between each pair of stops --- given by the ratio between cumulative network distance $S$ and departure time $t$ for a consecutive pair of valid stop_ids ($i$), 
$$
\overline{Speed_i} = \frac{S_{i+1}-S_i}{t_{i+1}-t_i}.
$$
Since the beginning of each trip usually starts before the first stop_id, the mean speed cannot be calculated as shown in the previous equation, because information on $i$ period does not exist. In this case, the function considers the mean speed for the whole trip. It also happens after the last valid stop_id ($N$) of the trips, where info on $i+1$ also does not exist. 

$$
Speed_N = Speed_0 = \overline{Speed} = \frac{S_N-S_1}{t_N-t_1}
$$
